Sentiment Analysis Algorithm
The system uses a sophisticated multi-layer analysis approach:
1. Keyword Matching: Three-tier intensity system (strong/medium/light) for nuanced detection
2. Context Awareness: Full sentence structure analysis and word relationship understanding
3. Negation Handling: Proper processing of phrases like "not good" vs "good"
4. Phrase Recognition: Detection of common expressions like "can't wait" and "feel sad"
5. Punctuation Analysis: Enhanced detection of caps, exclamations, ellipsis, and emoticons
6. Confidence Scoring: Dynamic confidence based on text length, keyword density, and context clarity
7. Mixed Emotion Logic: Prioritizes specific emotions over general ones when scores are close
